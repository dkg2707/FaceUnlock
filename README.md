# FaceUnlock

Used HaarCascades and LBH algorithm for face recognition

Gathered real time training data

Trained the data and the model recognizes the person in real time and show Unlocked if recognized and Locked if not recognized

I tried different haarcascades already available and found haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml to be the best for face recognition.
